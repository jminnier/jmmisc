JM's Trivial Package of Miscellaneous Functions

Includes

- an extension to the [tableone](https://github.com/kaz-yos/tableone) package
- an R markdown template, inspired by @emilelatour and @ismayc
- a couple random helper functions that my Phd advisor, Tianxi Cai, passed down to all of her students
